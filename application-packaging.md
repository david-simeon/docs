Packaging applications with Simeon
===============
There are three main benefits to packaging applications with Simeon. 
1. Package an application once and deploy it across any/all of your tenants.
2. Update your application package over time. This enables users to push out updates to application package without having to re-package the application.
3. Track changes made to your application package with version history (git).
